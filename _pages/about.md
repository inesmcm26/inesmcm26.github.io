&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello and welcome to my webpage! I'm InÃªs, a Data Science and Machine Learning student from Lisbon, Portugal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm interested in optimization, computer vision, NLP, and causality, and I love learning and sharing my knowledge with the community.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm involved in research projects and personal projects, and I'm excited to contribute to the ML community. Through this blog, I hope to share my experiences and insights with you and contribute to the machine learning community.
